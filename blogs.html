                <p class="description">No dive trip to Raja Ampat is complete without hunting for the plethora of pygmy seahorses that reside in the region. These minute fish are so unique in looks, the way they move through the water, and their behaviours, it is almost unbelievable that they are real. Raja Ampat has amongst the highest recorded density of pygmy seahorses in the world, so it really is the perfect place to meet them.</p>

                <p class="description">When it comes to birds, Raja Ampat might be more famous for its endemic bird of paradise species, but there is another species you must see while you are there. Locally called Kokomo, burung taun-taun, Blyth’s hornbill, or the Papuan hornbill, is a truly exquisite bird to see in the wild. Even if you aren’t a birding enthusiast, going on a hornbill tour is an exhilarating experience.</p>

                <p class="title">Managing the Fine Balance Between Tourism and Conservation in Raja Ampat</p>
                <p class="description">Until the early 2000’s Raja Ampat’s main industries were mining and fishing. The area is rich in nickel and cobalt, and of course fish, which had been keeping the region economically stable for centuries. However, with the rising awareness of the environmental importance of Raja Ampat, sustainable alternatives had to be implemented. This is why the management of natural capital is so important for the government and local people of Raja Ampat.</p>
